## Data Analysis Project

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(janitor)
library(tigris)
library(dplyr)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
voter_data_2024<- read_csv("data/election_results.csv") |> clean_names()

voter_data_2024 <- voter_data |>
  mutate(wrteins= sharon_e_harris_write_in_democratic + ralph_jaffe_write_in_democratic + paij_boring_and_jaimey_rutschman_write_in_republican + sethatina_newman_write_in_republican + carol_asher_write_in_other_candidates + jokie_beckett_jr_write_in_other_candidates + claudia_de_la_cruz_and_karina_garcia_write_in_other_candidates + john_r_gibb_jr_write_in_other_candidates + joseph_kishore_write_in_other_candidates + william_p_stodden_write_in_other_candidates + shiva_ayyadurai_and_crystal_ellis_write_in_unaffiliated + president_r_boddie_write_in_unaffiliated + theo_brown_sr_write_in_unaffiliated + susan_maude_buchser_write_in_unaffiliated + john_cheng_and_wayne_waligorski_write_in_unaffiliated + cherunda_fox_write_in_unaffiliated + garry_hubbard_and_elizabeth_seymour_write_in_unaffiliated + shondra_irving_write_in_unaffiliated + douglas_jenkins_write_in_unaffiliated + brian_larry_kienitz_write_in_unaffiliated + richard_mayers_write_in_unaffiliated + andre_ramon_mc_neil_sr_write_in_unaffiliated + future_madam_potus_and_jessica_kennedy_write_in_unaffiliated + benjamin_l_schwalb_write_in_unaffiliated + peter_sonski_write_in_unaffiliated + lester_h_waller_jr_write_in_unaffiliated + cornel_west_and_melina_abdullah_write_in_unaffiliated + michael_yost_write_in_unaffiliated + other_write_ins)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
